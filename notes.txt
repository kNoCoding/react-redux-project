1. create components and make sure app still renders as expected


this is how to todo going to be:
{
_id,
txt,
isDone,
createdAt
}


2. create/edit the necessary services

++++++++todo.service.js - working on this ATM

make sure to come back and implement the:
	TodoList
	TodoFilter
	TodoPreview
	TodoIndex
	

3. update the store
4. connect comps and services
